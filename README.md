As my practice for a role based around Java for the backend I used this to train my java skills and OOP fundamentals.

-SportsBetting Program. Using the SportsBettor.java, Betting.java, and temaCodeRunner.java(main) files you can try out my betting simuilation.
  -Replace the code in main with similar Code with your own Object Creation and inputs to try it for yourself. You can also follow the Betting.java file to create your own bet methods or modify the existing one in place!
